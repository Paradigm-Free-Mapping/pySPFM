# Usage

`pySPFM` has two main ways of usage: using a fixed selection of the regularization parameter lambda,
or using the stability selection method, which avoids the selection of lambda and yields more robust
estimates of the neuronal-related signal at the cost of higher computation time.

## Fixed regularization parameter lambda

The fixed $\lambda$ method is the simplest one. It consists in choosing one of the following methods
to automatically calculate the regularization parameter lambda:

- `universal threshold`:
  $\lambda = \sigma * \sqrt{2 * \log(T)}$, where $\sigma$ is the median absolute
  deviation of the estimated level of noise and T is the number of TRs.
- `lower universal threshold`:
  $\lambda = \sigma * \sqrt{2 * \log(T) - \log(1 + 4 * \log(T))}$, where $\sigma$
  is the median absolute deviation of the estimated level of noise and T is the number of TRs.
- `median absolute deviation`:
  Calculate lambda as the median absolute deviation of fine-scale wavelet coefficients
  (Daubechies, order 3). For more information, see [Karahanoglu et al. (2013)].
- `updating median absolute deviation`:
  Median absolute deviation of the estimated level of the noise that gets updated on each
  iteration (see [Karahanoglu et al. (2013)]):
  $\lambda_{n+1} = {\frac{N \sigma}{\frac{1}{2} \| \mathbf{y} - \mathbf{Hs} \|_2^2 \lambda_n}}$.
- `percentage of maximum lambda`:
  percentage of the maximum lambda possible to use as lambda.
  $\lambda = \textrm{pcg} * \lambda_{max}$,
  where $\lambda_{max}= \| \mathbf{H}^T \mathbf{y} \|$ and
  $0 \leq \textrm{pcg} \leq 1$
- `factor of median absolute deviation`:
  factor of the estimate of the level of noise to use as lambda.
  $\lambda = \textrm{factor} * \sigma, with 0 \leq \textrm{factor} \leq 1$

```bash
pySPFM -i my_echo_1.nii.gz my_echo_3.nii.gz my_echo_3.nii.gz -m my_mask.nii.gz
-te 14.5, 38.5, 62.5 -o my_subject_pySPFM -tr 2 -d my_results_directory -crit mad
```

## Stability selection

The stability selection procedure solves the regularization problem in a number of subsampled
surrogate datasets `-nsur` with the Least Angle Regression algorithm.

```bash
pySPFM -i my_data.nii.gz -m my_mask.nii.gz -o my_subject_stability_selection -tr 2
-d my_results_directory -crit stability -nsur 50
```
