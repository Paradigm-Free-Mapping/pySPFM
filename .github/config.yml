  Thanks for opening this pull request!
  We have detected this is the first time you have contributed
  to *template-package*.

  We invite you to list yourself as a *template-package* contributor, so if your name
  is not already mentioned, please modify the
  [``.zenodo.json``](https://github.com/ME-ICA/template-package/blob/main/.zenodo.json).

  Of course, if you want to opt out this time there is no
  problem at all with adding your name later.
  You will be always welcome to add it in the future whenever
  you feel it should be listed.
